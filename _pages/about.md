Welcome to my personal academic website. Here, I share my academic work and research interests. 

Currently I am a postdoc at the University of Bern working on a project funded by the [Multidisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases](https://www.mcid.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Christian Althaus](https://calthaus.github.io/) and [Julien Riou](https://www.unisante.ch/fr/formation-recherche/annuaire-chercheurs/chercheur/riou-julien). The project title is "Early detection for early action: integrating multiple data
sources for monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in near
real-time" and includes work on transmission modelling of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland as well as developing causal inference methods for routinely collected hospital data. More information about these and other projects can be found below.
