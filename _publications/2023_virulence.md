HIV-1 subtypes differ in their clinical manifestations and the speed in which they spread. In particular, the frequency of subtype C is increasing relative to subtypes A and D. We investigate whether HIV-1 subtypes A, C and D differ in their per-pathogen virulence and to what extend this explains the difference in spread between these subtypes. We use data from the hormonal contraception and HIV-1 genital shedding and disease progression among women with primary HIV infection study. For each study participant, we determine the set-point viral load value, CD4+ T cell level after primary infection and CD4+ T cell decline. Based on both the CD4+ T cell count after primary infection and CD4+ T cell decline, we estimate the time until AIDS. We then obtain our newly introduced measure of virulence as the inverse of the estimated time until AIDS. After fitting a model to the measured virulence and set-point viral load values, we tested if this relation varies per subtype. We found that subtype C has a significantly higher per-pathogen virulence than subtype A. Based on an evolutionary model, we then hypothesize that differences in the primary length of infection period cause the observed variation in the speed of spread of the subtypes.
